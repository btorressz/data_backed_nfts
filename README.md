# data_backed_nfts

This project implements a **Data-Backed NFT program** on the Solana blockchain using the **Anchor Framework**. The system allows the minting of NFTs that represent access to specific datasets, and it manages access control, leasing, and ownership transfer using **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**.
**THIS PROJECT IS A PROTOTYPE**

## Features
- **Mint NFTs** that represent access to datasets.
- **Access Control**: Only NFT holders can access premium datasets.
- **Leasing**: NFT holders can extend their access through leasing mechanisms.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Transfer the ownership of datasets to other users.
- **Fee-Based Access**: Users can be charged a fee (in SPL tokens) to access datasets.

  ### Key Files
- `lib.rs`: Contains the core logic for the program.
- `anchor.test.ts`: Unit tests for the program using Anchor's testing framework.
- `client.ts`: Example client script to interact with the deployed program.

  ## Tech Stack
  Rust, Typescript Solana, Anchor, Solana playground ide

  ## Program Methods

### `initialize`
Initializes a new data account for a dataset. This account is associated with a specific NFT mint and is used to control access to the dataset.

### `grant_access`
Allows NFT holders to access the dataset if they hold the necessary NFT.

### `extend_lease`
Extends the access period for a dataset, allowing users to renew or lease their access rights.

### `transfer_ownership`
Transfers ownership of a dataset to a new user.

### `grant_access_with_fee`
Grants access to a dataset but requires the user to pay a fee in SPL tokens (such as USDC).

## Future Features

### 1. Dynamic Pricing for Dataset Access
Currently, access fees are static, but dynamic pricing could be implemented based on market conditions, demand, or specific time periods. This would enable NFT holders to adjust prices depending on dataset value, time of access, or other variables.

### 2. Support for Multiple Data Feeds per NFT
Enhancing the program to allow an NFT to provide access to multiple datasets instead of just one. This would make the NFTs more flexible, enabling holders to access various types of data streams based on their needs.

### 3. Subscription-Based Access
Introduce recurring payments or subscription models where users pay a periodic fee (e.g., monthly) to maintain access to a dataset. This would provide a more robust leasing system where access is automatically revoked if the user fails to make a payment.

### 4. Data Resale and Royalties
Allow users to resell access to the datasets, while implementing royalties so that the original dataset owner gets a percentage of each resale. This would incentivize dataset owners to create valuable, tradable datasets and provide liquidity for data access.

### 5. Cross-Chain Data Access
Expand the functionality to allow cross-chain interaction, meaning data-backed NFTs on Solana can provide access to datasets or services on other blockchains. This would allow users to leverage their NFT across multiple platforms and ecosystems.

### 6. Integration with Oracles for Real-Time Data
Allow the NFT to represent real-time data access (e.g., stock prices, weather updates) by integrating with oracles like Chainlink or Pyth. This would enable NFT holders to receive live data feeds tied to their NFTs.
